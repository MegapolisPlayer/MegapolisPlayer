# Hi!
I'm a student with some free time on my hands! I usually code in C/C++, but I sometimes do stuff in other languages.

## Open-source software
Most of my smaller projects **are** open-source, but if I'm doing something commercial or large, I don't really like having it open-source.
Unless stated otherwise, all of my projects here on GitHub are open-source, free to use or redistribute, even for commercial purposes.
Most of my project are licensed under CC-BY 4.0.

## Current Projects
*CountryFramework* - a cross platform GUI framework (closed-source, free to use and open-source docs)

*MuffleSpeech* - a speech muffler

## Unsupported/Deprecated Projects
*MinisterOS* - just a **test x86 BIOS OS** which displays time, RAM and CPU vendor
