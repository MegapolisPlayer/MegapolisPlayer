# Hello!
I'm a student interested in transit, technology, maths and technology overall!

# Experience
- **C++**: I use this language pretty regularly since 2020. Perhaps one of my favourite languages to date - I wrote a few graphical frameworks and a tram simulator.
- **C**: Perhaps my second favourite language: wrote a (pretty rudimentary) webcrawler a server as well as a few bootloaders.
- **JS and TS** and *HTML, CSS*: Also a language I often use (and have done some for multiple years at this point), usually paired with some frameworks (SvelteKit). I do sometimes use vanilla JS though.
- **Java**: 2 years of (forced) experience with Java, used it for some GUI apps and some messing around
- **Python**: Multiple years experience with vanilla Python, a bit of experience with Django, Matplotlib, Pandas and Notebooks.
