# Hi!
I'm a student with some free time on my hands! I usually code in C/C++, but I sometimes do stuff in other languages.

## Open-source software
Most of my smaller projects **are** open-source, but if I'm doing something commercial or large, I don't really like having it open-source.
Unless stated otherwise, all of my projects here on GitHub are open-source, so feel free to use or redistribute them, even for commercial purposes.
Most of my projects are licensed under CC-BY 4.0.

## Future Projects (planned, haven't begun yet)
*CppH* - an C++ interpreter for Fowsoft's H Scripting Language (in different repo)

*STBIWrap* - a STB Image wrapper for GLFW and CountryFramework

## Small Projects (not really updated but supported)

## Current Projects
*CountryFramework* - a cross platform GUI framework (closed-source, free to use and open-source docs)

## Unsupported/Deprecated Projects
*MinisterOS* - just a **test x86 BIOS OS** which displays time, RAM and CPU vendor

*MuffleSpeech* - a speech muffler (community branch)
