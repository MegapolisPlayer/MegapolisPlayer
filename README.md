# Hi!
I'm a student with some free time on my hands! I usually code in C/C++, but I sometimes do stuff in other languages.

## Open-source software
Most of my smaller projects **are** open-source, but if I'm doing something commercial or large, I don't really like having it open-source.
Unless stated otherwise, all of my projects here on GitHub are open-source, so feel free to use or redistribute them, even for commercial purposes.
Most of my projects are licensed under CC-BY 4.0.

## Future Projects (planned, haven't begun yet)

*STBIWrap* - a STB Image wrapper for GLFW and CountryFramework

*Cominplat* - a common base platform for interpreters

## Small Projects (not really updated but supported)

CppUtils - utilities for C++ to provide some very basic functionality

U2D License - a license for commerical projects

## Current Projects
*Versailles* - a cross platform x64 game engine (closed-source, free to use and open-source docs)

   - *Geneva* - a debugger for Versailles
   - *Belgrade* - a graphical user interface for Versailles

## Unsupported/Deprecated Projects
*MinisterOS* - just a **test x86 BIOS OS** which displays time, RAM and CPU vendor

*MuffleSpeech* - a speech muffler (does still get small bugfixes if necessary.

## Contributing
Please contribute. Like actually, please do.
