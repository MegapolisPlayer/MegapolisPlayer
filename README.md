# Hi!
I'm a student with some free time on my hands! I usually code in C/C++, but I sometimes do stuff in other languages.

## Open-source software
Most of my smaller projects **are** open-source, but if I'm doing something commercial or large, I don't really like having it open-source.
Unless stated otherwise, all of my projects here on GitHub are open-source, so feel free to use or redistribute them, even for commercial purposes.
Most of my projects are licensed under CC-BY 4.0.

## Small Projects (not updated but supported)

CppUtils - utilities for C++ to provide some very basic functionality

U2D License - a license for commerical projects

PositionPointCounter - a small calc for calculating points based on place (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc.)

## Current Projects
openArabTools - an open-source C++ implemenation of a student-only Java library

MCServerStatusBot - an open-source C++ Discord Bot for getting the status of a Minecraft Server

## Unsupported, Deprecated or Test Projects
*MinisterOS* - just a **test x86 BIOS OS** which displays time, RAM and CPU vendor

*SimpleUEFI* - a "simple" UEFI x64 boot example

## Other

Other projects (aka. the ones not mentioned here) are usually either testing or abandoned projects without any significance.

## Contributing
Please contribute to the larger repos. Like actually, please do.
